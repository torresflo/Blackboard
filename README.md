  <h1 align="center">Blackboard</h3>

  <p align="center">
    A C++ container that can store any value of any type referenced by a unique ID.
    <br />
    Usually, Blackboards are used in games in combination of a behavior tree to store and retrieve easily data or computation results.       <br/>
    But they can also be used as a usefull container that can store anything.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Clone the repo (`git clone https:://github.com/torresflo/Blackboard.git`) and add the Container folder to your project, you are ready to go!

## Usage

You can have a look at the example below.

### Example

```cpp
#include <Container\Blackboard.hpp>

//Declaration of the blackboard and the managed types
Container::Blackboard<int, bool, std::string> blackboard;

//Declaration of some IDs to use
blackboard.declare<int>(BLACKBOARD_ID("IDInteger"), 0);
blackboard.declare<bool>(BLACKBOARD_ID("IDBool"), false);
blackboard.declare<std::string>(BLACKBOARD_ID("IDString"), "My String");

//You can register a callback to be informed when a value has changed
blackboard.declare<int>(BLACKBOARD_ID("IDIntegerWithCallback"), [](const int& currentValue, const int& newValue) { /* ... */ });

//Let's use the container
blackboard.setValue<int>(BLACKBOARD_ID("IDInteger"), 42);
int myInt = blackboard.getValue<int>(BLACKBOARD_ID("IDInteger"));

// Warning: you cannot access non existing IDs
bool myBoolean = blackboard.getValue<bool>(BLACKBOARD_ID("AnInvalidID")); //This will create an out_of_range exception.

//Better to do this if the id is unknown
if(blackboard.exist<bool>(BLACKBOARD_ID("AnUnknonwID")))
{
    bool myBoolean = blackboard.getValue<bool>(BLACKBOARD_ID("AnUnknonwID")); //Can access safely
    //...
}
//Or to do this
bool myBoolean = blackboard.getValue<bool>(BLACKBOARD_ID("AnUnknonwID"), false); //Will return the default value provided: false

//...
```

### Performance

#### Blackboard ID

The generation of the Blackboard IDs are done with a hashing function that SHOULD be computed at compile time if the used string is constant.

Sadly, some compilers may not optimize it. In this case, a couple of bit operations are done for each letter of the string. It means, the longer is the string, the longer it will be to generate the Blackboard ID.

#### Storing

Internally, the Blackboard is using `std::unordered_map` (you cannot access this container directly).

It means the complexity in both reading and writing is:
- Average case: constant
- Worst case: linear in size.

For information about performance and complexity of the `std::unordered_map`, see <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/unordered_map">here</a>.
